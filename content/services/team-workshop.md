## Communication and Management
Before you can speak, you should learn to listen. This is all you need to know about communication. But it requires practice. This workshop focus on the listening skill. Improv is all about listening first.

## Presentation Skills
Every time we ask, why people don't want to present in front of an audience the answer is always the same: ''fear''.
Fear of being judged, of looking stupid, of being boring.

Fear is a perfectly normal sensation, it’s due to the evolution of our brain. We evolved to survive and although the brain is wired to spot dangers, it can freeze in front of them. Our body responds to fear, by letting more blood going to our legs in case we need to run.
Fear is important, it makes you focus. Improv helps you to embrace it.
We are afraid to stand in front of an audience, because we are afraid of being looked at, afraid of being judged or afraid that something will go wrong.
Get a positive attitude to mistakes. You can’t learn anything without doing mistakes, so take risks.
