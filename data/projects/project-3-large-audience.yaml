description: Fear is a perfectly normal sensation, it’s due to the evolution of our brain. We evolved to survive and although the brain is wired to spot dangers, it can freeze in front of them. Our body responds to fear, by letting more blood going to our legs in case we need to run.<br/>Fear is important, it makes you focus. Improv helps you embrace the fear.<br/>We are afraid to stand in front of an audience, because we are afraid of being looked at, afraid of being judged or afraid that something will go wrong.<br/>Get a positive attitude to mistakes, you can’t learn anything without doing mistakes. So take risks.
