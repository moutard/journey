          There is a common trait between jazz improvisation, working on a play, and releasing a software. It’s always a team effort. You can’t do it alone. A play requires comedians, stage manager, light engineers to prepare and rehearse for weeks then finally work in perfect synchronisation during the show. Improv comedians all know that.

        <blockquote cite="Tim Berners-Lee">I worked on a worldwide release, it took 20 teams across 5 timezones to work hand in hand for 5 months and finally everyone was involved during the 2h release. This would never happen without communication and team trust.</blockquote>

          Every time we ask, why people don't want to present in front of an audience the answer is always the same: ''fear''.
          Fear of being judged, of looking stupid, of being boring.

          Fear is a perfectly normal sensation, it’s due to the evolution of our brain. We evolved to survive and although the brain is wired to spot dangers, it can freeze in front of them. Our body responds to fear, by letting more blood going to our legs in case we need to run.
          Fear is important, it makes you focus. Improv helps you to embrace it.
          We are afraid to stand in front of an audience, because we are afraid of being looked at, afraid of being judged or afraid that something will go wrong.
          Get a positive attitude to mistakes. You can’t learn anything without doing mistakes, so take risks.
